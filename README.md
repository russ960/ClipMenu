# ClipMenu
Convenient system-tray menu for saving and copying small text snippets.  The original application was created by flarn2006.  

This version converts ClipMenu to utilize a SQLite instance to store snippets.  Currently this inital conversion is near completion.

In a future release I hope to incorporate a multi-line input box to store whole sections of text versus individual lines.
